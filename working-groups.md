# Working groups and Participation

Participation in any IFTAS activity is subject to our [Community Participation Guidelines](https://about.iftas.org/iftas-community-participation-guidelines/)

Please join the [IFTAS Matrix Chat](https://matrix.to/#/#space:matrix.iftas.org) to participate in workgroup activites.

Working groups follow our [Decision Making](https://cryptpad.fr/pad/#/2/pad/edit/BxarixOwv0zuUPOr1X4A0r8b/) process. All attempts at achieving consensus begin with a good faith attempt at generating full-agreement, regardless of decision rule threshold. Workgroup Leads and Moderators are expected to consider all blocks but may forward recommendations and decisions at any time, providing such blocks are forwarded with the decision or recommendation.

## Working Groups

### WG-Blocklists
 - Charter: https://cryptpad.fr/pad/#/2/pad/edit/BpPbHM0MKJwBsU7y1am5vhGp/ 
 - Working Group: https://chat.iftas.org/#/room/#wg-blocklists:matrix.iftas.org

In an open federation model, malicious actors with low barrier to entry are able to federate with the entire community of service providers, potentially exposing member accounts to unallowed content and conduct. The Blocklists workgroup is convened to provide a body of knowledge describing blocklist activities, best practices, lessons learned, and to work towards actionable recommendations to promote the integrity of blocklist construction and dissemination.

IFTAS intends to be a beacon of safety for social media members, and as such plans to work toward a broadly accepted and respected blocklist service that is available at install, with routine updates, in all major activitypub platforms.
